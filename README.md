# WorldTensor GeoZarr

**757 harmonized Earth-system variables (1900–2025, 0.25°) as one cloud-native GeoZarr store, with a WebGL globe viewer that streams it directly from object storage.**

This repo converts the [WorldTensor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.03298) NetCDF release into a single GeoZarr store on [Source Cooperative](https://source.coop) and serves a static viewer for it. There is no tile server: the browser reads Zarr chunks over HTTP range requests.

## Use the data

```python
import xarray as xr

ds = xr.open_zarr("https://data.source.coop/tge-labs/worldtensor/worldtensor.zarr/climate/t2m_mean")
ds.t2m_mean.sel(time="2025", lat=48.85, lon=2.35, method="nearest")  # Paris, K
```

Each variable is its own group (`<domain>/<variable>`, e.g. `ocean/chl_max`, `static/soil_properties/bdod_0-5cm_mean`). Opening a group is a single request because its metadata is consolidated. `catalog.json` at the store root lists all 757 variables with their units, years and default color ranges.

| array | chunks | serves |
|---|---|---|
| `<var>` (721 × 1440) | 1 year × 361 × 360 | full resolution, 8 tiles per year |
| `2x/<var>` | 1 year × whole globe | the global view in one request |
| `4x/<var>`, `8x/<var>` | all years × whole globe | the time slider in one request |
| `ts/<var>` | all years × 16 × 16, one shard | a pixel's full history in about 40 KB |

The store is lossless: float32 with Blosc zstd and byte shuffle, NaN as nodata. The grid is EPSG:4326 cell centers, with latitude ascending from −90 to 90 and longitude running 0 to 359.75.

### GeoZarr

Every group follows CF-1.8: a `spatial_ref` grid mapping with WKT and a GDAL `GeoTransform`, and `grid_mapping` plus `coordinates` on each data array. Each group also carries the zarr-conventions v0.1 [`multiscales`](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/multiscales), [`proj`](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/proj) and [`spatial`](https://github.com/zarr-conventions/spatial) attributes. Overview levels are built by 2× averaging, and they drop the odd 90°N row so that every level is exactly affine. [`pipeline/09_validate.py`](pipeline/09_validate.py) checks all 3,028 levels against the official schemas, against the coordinate arrays and against rioxarray; it currently reports 0 errors.

## Viewer

<p>
  <img src="docs/assets/playback.gif" width="43%" alt="Animating 2-meter temperature, 1940–2025">
  <img src="docs/assets/soil.png" width="55%" alt="Clay content at 15–30 cm over South America, with the depth facet selected">
</p>

The viewer uses Bun, Vite, TypeScript, a MapLibre globe and deck.gl-raster's [`ZarrLayer`](https://github.com/developmentseed/deck.gl-raster).

- **Time playback:** the 8× overview holds every year in one GPU texture, so a variable animates as soon as it opens. Once the paused view has loaded, the viewer prefetches the selected variable's 2× level (0.5°, about 43 MB for temperature) into a second all-years texture in the background and switches to it, so playback runs at the same resolution as the paused globe view and makes no network requests. Pausing fetches the full-resolution year you're on.
- **No metadata requests:** array metadata comes from `catalog.json`, and chunk bytes are deduplicated and cached in memory.
- **Finding variables:** the 757 variables collapse into 349 families. Statistic (mean/min/max/std), soil depth and land-use from→to pairs are switches on the selected variable instead of separate list entries. The left panel is a domain → family tree, and **⌘K** (or **/**) searches everything.
- **Colormaps:** keys **1–6** switch between viridis, plasma, inferno, magma, cividis and turbo; *more* opens the full set (cmocean, ColorBrewer, diverging).
- **Hover** reads the exact pixel value. **Clicking** reads that pixel's whole history from the sharded `ts` array and plots it with a trend per decade.

```bash
cd app && bun install
WT_DATA=/path/to/worldtensor.zarr bun run dev                                         # local store at /data
VITE_DATA_URL=https://data.source.coop/tge-labs/worldtensor/worldtensor.zarr bun run build
```

## Pipeline

SLURM scripts in [`pipeline/`](pipeline/) run download → extract → manifest → convert → pyramid and `ts` → GeoZarr metadata → consolidation → catalog → validation. See [`pipeline/README.md`](pipeline/README.md) for the steps and how to run them end to end.

## Development

```bash
# viewer (Bun): strict TypeScript check + production build
cd app && bun install && bun run build

# pipeline (uv): format, lint, type check
uv run --group dev ruff format --check pipeline
uv run --group dev ruff check pipeline
uv run --group dev ty check pipeline
```

CI runs both on every push and pull request. Issues and pull requests are welcome.
